# Project 1: Recognizing Textual Entailment

## Description
For Project-2, you will implement a feature-driven model that extracts named entities (NEs) from a document. The goal is to extract relevant concepts from a document such as names of persons, locations, geo-political entities, etc. To train your NER model, you are provided with the CoNLL-2003 English dataset [1]. This corpus describes four kinds of NE's: Locations (LOC), Organizations (ORG), Persons (PER) and Miscellaneous (MISC). This corpus follows the BIO notation for representing labels where B marks the beginning of a tag, I marks the continuation of a previous tag and O marks that the given token is a named entity.
